# Art & Design for 1418

## Pixel portraits
On the [team page](http://1418.team/team) of our website, many members of the team have flat pixel portraits of themselves above their bios. Making these is easier than it may look, but the process may be difficult to see at first, so below is a guide.

GIMP, a free & open source photo editor, is used in this guide. You can do it in any capable editor, but GIMP is recommended. Download it [here](http://www.gimp.org/downloads/).

1. Find a good photo of the member. It's best if this photo has the member in primary view, not in the background, but this isn't necessary. Just use your best judgement to find the best photo you can. Good places to find photos are the [team Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/robotics1418/) and individual member pages on various social media.  
2. Crop the photo down to a square with only the person's head and shoulders in the frame. Leave a reasonable amount of margin above the person's head.  
3. Scale the image down to 64x64 pixels, with _Interpolation: None_. Using interpolation will make your task harder later on.  
4. Using the pencil tool at size 1, draw over the member's shirt or other clothing using the following colors: `#cf2e2e` for light portions, `#b52828` for middle brightness, and `#942121` for the most shadowed areas. When you're done, it should look like a red, somewhat flattened version of whatever they were wearing before.
5. Perform the same process as above on the person's hair and face (draw over all facial features), but instead of the above red colors, use colors that fit their hair & skin colors the closest. Use a maximum of two colors for their hair and two for their skin.
6. Export the file as a PNG image. On our website, we use the name format firstname.png. For students with the same first name as another student, we use firstname-lastinitial.png.
